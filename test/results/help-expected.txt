protocurl <version>, build <hash>, https://github.com/qaware/protocurl

Send and receive Protobuf messages over HTTP via `curl` and interact with it using human-readable text formats.

Usage:
  protocurl [flags] -f proto-file -i request-type -o response-type -u url -d request-text

It uses 'curl' from PATH. If none was found, it will fall back to an internal non-configurable http request.
It uses a bundled 'protoc' (by default) which is used to parse the .proto files.
The bundle also includes the google protobuf .proto files necessary to create FileDescriptorSet payloads via 'protoc'.
If the bundled 'protoc' is used, then these .proto files are included. Otherwise .proto files from the system-wide include are used.
The Header 'Content-Type: application/x-protobuf' is set as a request header by default.
When converting between binary and text, the encoding UTF-8 is always used.

Examples:
  protocurl -I my-protos -f messages.proto -i package.path.Req -o package.path.Resp -u http://example.com/api -d "myField: true, otherField: 1337"

Flags:
  -u, --URL string                Mandatory: The url to send the request to
      --curl                      Forces the use of curl executable found in PATH. If none was found, then exits with an error.
  -C, --curl-args string          Additional cURL args which will be passed on to cURL during request invocation for further configuration. Also activates --curl.
      --curl-path string          Uses the given path to invoke curl instead of searching for curl in PATH. Also activates --curl.
  -d, --data-text string          Mandatory: The payload data in Protobuf text format. See https://github.com/qaware/protocurl
  -D, --display-binary-and-http   Displays the binary request and response as well as the non-binary response headers.
  -h, --help                      help for protocurl
      --no-curl                   Forces the use of the built-in internal http request instead of curl.
  -I, --proto-dir string          Uses the specified directory to find the proto-file. (default "/proto")
  -f, --proto-file string         Uses the specified file path to find the Protobuf definition of the message types within 'proto-dir' (relative file path).
      --protoc                    Forces the use of a global protoc executable found in PATH or via --protoc-path instead of using the bundled one. If none was found, then exits with an error.
      --protoc-path string        Uses the given path to invoke protoc instead of searching for protoc in PATH. Also activates --protoc.
  -H, --request-header string     Adds the string header to the invocation of cURL. This option is not supported when --no-curl is active. E.g. -H 'MyHeader: FooBar'.
  -i, --request-type string       Mandatory: Package path of the Protobuf request type. E.g. mypackage.MyRequest
  -o, --response-type string      Mandatory: Package path of the Protobuf response type. E.g. mypackage.MyResponse
  -q, --show-output-only          Suppresses all output except response Protobuf as text.Overrides and deactivates -v and -D. Errors are still printed to stderr.
  -v, --verbose                   Prints version and enables verbose output. Also activates -D.
      --version                   version for protocurl
