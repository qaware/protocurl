# Why does this branch exist?

This branch was created as an attempt to compile the C++ Google Protobuf source code.

**Why?** Because, we wanted to
access [this class](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/cpp/google.protobuf.compiler.importer)
to be able to directly parse .proto files during runtime and work with them dynamically. This is only possible in C++ (
which is what protobuf is written in) and in no other language SDKs.

Alternatively, we could use any other language (e.g. Go, as it is now) and use a `protoc` during runtime. This is
unfortunate in that it adds a runtime dependency which cannot be avoided at all.

For ease of use and simplicity, protocurl should only be a simple fat binary - instead of requiring to run with a
bundled or PATH protoc.

**Why did we not choose C++, and write the CLI in that?** Because we wanted cross-compiled fat binaries and for the
scope of the tool and the effort necessary, we did not have the background knowledge and time investment to figure out
how to cross-compile Google protobuf libraries into the protocurl fat binaries. We did however succeed in compiling
Google Protobuf as is on a custom build platform. Cross-compilation and fat binaries in C++ with CMake and Bazel is
hard, if you have little or no experience with them.

**So why does this branch exist?** For documentation and for the eventual possibility of getting rid of the protoc
dependency during runtime.

**How?** We could in principle compile the minimally needed methods to a [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)
binary (.wasm) - which can be embedded into the fat binary and be called efficiently with Go code with a Go WASM
runtime (e.g. [wasmer-go](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go)).

**Why brother with that?** Using WASM is an interesting learning experience, and it has a good future. This approach
will simplify builds, deployment, avoid fallback logic in the code as well as simplify usage for users. Finally, it's as
fast as native code instead of spawning a new process every time.

todo: update once everything is in go

# Examples

After starting the local test server via `docker-compose -f test/servers/compose.yml up --build server`, you can send
the following list of requests via protoCURL.

Each request needs to mount the directory of proto files into the containers `/proto` path to ensure, that they are
visible inside the docker container.

```
$ docker run -v "$PWD/test/proto:/proto" protocurl \
  -f happyday.proto -i happyday.HappyDayRequest -o happyday.HappyDayResponse \
  -u http://localhost:8080/happy-day/verify \
  "includeReason: true"

=========================== Request Text   =========================== >>>
includeReason: true
=========================== Response Text   =========================== <<<
isHappyDay: true
reason: "Thursday is a Happy Day! \342\255\220"
formattedDate: "Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT"
```

```
$ docker run -v "$PWD/test/proto:/proto" protocurl \
  -f happyday.proto -i happyday.HappyDayRequest -o happyday.HappyDayResponse \
  -u http://localhost:8080/happy-day/verify ""

=========================== Request Text   =========================== >>>
=========================== Response Text   =========================== <<<
isHappyDay: true
reason: "Thursday is a Happy Day! \342\255\220"
formattedDate: "Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT"
```

```
$ docker run -v "$PWD/test/proto:/proto" protocurl \
  -f happyday.proto -i happyday.HappyDayRequest -o happyday.HappyDayResponse \
  -u http://localhost:8080/happy-day/verify \
  "date: { seconds: 1648044939}"

=========================== Request Text   =========================== >>>
date {
  seconds: 1648044939
}
=========================== Response Text   =========================== <<<
reason: "Tough luck on Wednesday... \360\237\230\225"
formattedDate: "Wed, 23 Mar 2022 14:15:39 GMT"
```

Use `-v` for verbose output:

```
$ docker run -v "$PWD/test/proto:/proto" protocurl \
  -v -f happyday.proto -i happyday.HappyDayRequest -o happyday.HappyDayResponse \
  -u http://localhost:8080/happy-day/verify \

# Protobuf Text Format

Aside from JSON, Protobuf also natively supports a text format. This is the only format, which `protoc` natively
implements and exposes.
(This is despite the fact, that every Protobuf SDK for the standard langauges also contains the JSON conversion
capabilities.)

This text format syntax
is [barely documented](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/cpp/google.protobuf.text_format),
so this section will shortly describe how to write Protobuf messages in the text format.

Given the following .proto file

```
syntax = "proto3";

import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";

message HappyDayRequest {
  google.protobuf.Timestamp date = 1;
  bool includeReason = 2;
  
  double myDouble = 3;
  int64 myInt64 = 5;
  string myString = 6;
  repeated NestedMessage messages = 9;
}

message NestedMessage {
  Foo fooEnum = 1;
  repeated int32 i = 4;
}

enum Foo {
  BAR = 0;
  BAZ = 1;
}
```

A `HappyDayRequest` message in text format might look like this:

```
includeReason: true,
myInt64: 123123123123,
myString: "hello world",
myDouble: 123.456,
messages: { fooEnum: BAR, i: 0, i: 1, i: 1337 },
messages: { i: 15, fooEnum: BAZ, i: -1337 },
messages: { },
date: { seconds: 123, nanos: 321 }
```

In summary:

* No encapsulating `{ ... }` are used for the top level message (in contrast to JSON).
* fields are comma separated and described via `<fieldname>: <value>`
* repeated fields are simply repeated multiple times (instead of using an array) and they do not need to appear
  consecutively.
* nested messages are described with `{ ... }` opening a new context and describing their fields recursively
* scalar values are describes similar to JSON
* enum values are referenced by their name
* built-in messages (such as [google.protobuf.Timestamp](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.Timestamp)
  are described just like user-defined custom messages via `{ ... }` and their message fields

# How to contribute

todo. And also link to [Developer](DEVELOPER.md).

# Tests

See [TESTS.md](TESTS.md)

# Release

See [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md)

# Potential Improvements

* **JSON support**: protoCURL currently only uses the text format. Using JSON as a conversion format would make it more
  useful and viable for everyday usage.
* **Protobuf format coverage**: The tests currently do not use strings, enums and other complex types. We want to
  increase the test coverage here and adapt protoCURL if necessary
* **Response failure handling**: protoCURL always attempts to interpret the response from the server as a Protobuf
  payload - even if the request has failed.
* **Multi-file support**: Currently, the request and response messages need to be in the same file. An improvement would
  be to allow the user to import a directory of Protobuf file and have protoCURL search for the definitions given the
  request and response types.
* **Pre-built releases of the image for various prorobuf versions on docker**
* **Raw Format**: If no .proto files for the response are available, then it's still possible to receive and decode
  messages. The decoding can happen in a way which only shows the field numbers and the field contents - without the
  field names - by using `protoc --decode_raw`. This might be useful for users of protoCURL.
* **Use a general purpose programming language**: To support JSON conversion and many other nice-to-have features, it
  would be better, easier and more reliable to use a proper programming language such as Go, C++, Rust, etc. to create
  the CLI and to build static binaries for the different operating systems and architectures.
* **Quality of Life Improvments**: Avoid explicitly specifying the file via `-f` and instead search the message types
  from `-i` and `-o`. Additionally, it should be sufficient to only use the name of the message type instead of the full
  path, whenever the message type is unique.

## Open TODOs

* Rewrite the Tool in Go. Use [GoRelease](https://goreleaser.com/intro/) to create static binaries and to release it as
  a docker container.
  * Explain, that goReleaser is used.
* Release the latest version on docker, via GitHub action under `qaware/protocurl`
* Check, if all mandatory arguments are given, and report errors otherwise.
* Since the base image seems to not be updated since a while, it would be better to directly include the most important
  commands via from its [Dockerfile](https://github.com/znly/docker-protobuf/blob/master/Dockerfile) into protoCURL
  directly
* `docker scan`
* Add note, that on some platforms such as Windows, an empty request text will not properly function if used with "".
  One will need " " (with a space) instead.
* Apply 12 factor CLI app principles
* re-generate example commands when go implementation is finished
